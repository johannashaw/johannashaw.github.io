        <h2>Hi! I'm Johanna</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in specializing in embedded 
          systems programming. My journey began at the University of Alberta, where I spent two years 
          pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. However, driven by my desire to gain 
          practical, hands-on experience, I made a decision to pursue a different path and enrolled in the
          Computer Engineering Technology program at NAIT.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At NAIT, I recently graduated from the Computer Engineering Technology program, which 
          provided me with comprehensive training in both computer hardware and software. The 
          program covered a wide range of topics, including computer architecture fundamentals, 
          industrial electronics, and embedded controllers utilizing analog and digital integration. I became 
          proficient in programming microcontrollers using C and microPython, as well as Windows 
          application development in C#, database concepts, and dynamic web development.
        </p>
              
        <p>
          Throughout the program, I gained expertise in various areas, such as computer programming, 
          system analysis and design, electronic circuit design and implementation, 
          debugging and simulation, embedded system implementation, interfacing sensors and actuators
          with computer platforms, hardware design and interfacing, as well as analytical thinking and 
          problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond technical expertise, the program also emphasized the development of essential 
          professional skills. I honed my oral and written communication abilities, sharpened my 
          interpersonal and teamwork skills, and learned the importance of time management and 
          effective collaboration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in computer engineering technology and a burning desire to specialize 
          in embedded systems programming, I am now ready to embark on a rewarding career in the 
          field. I am eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to innovative projects, and I am excited 
          about the opportunities that lie ahead in this dynamic and rapidly evolving industry.
